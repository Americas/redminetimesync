WHAT IS THIS?
- This is meant to help people (like me) that use both Hamster Applet (Gnome Time Tracker) and Redmine to keep trace of activities done.

HOW I CAN USE IT
- toDo

USAGE
1) Clone the repository: git clone git://github.com/shaftoe/redminetimesync.git
2) Edit redminetimesync.config: it's an INI-like file that needs three parameters:

db: /home/<your_username>/.local/share/hamster-applet/hamster.db
url: https://projects.devsum.it
key: <your_redmine_api_key_here>

where "db" is the full path to your hamster applet (SQLite 3) database, "url" is the URL of your Redmine (>= v1.1) and
"key" is the Redmine' API key

3) run the python script: ./redminetimesync.py
